# UCL_DV_On_the_momve
Group assignment for Digital Visualisation course @UCL (module CASA0003).

This project and accompanying report showcase and outline our approach to exploring and visualising population movement in a dynamic world and its cities. It speaks to the theme of Living Cities whereby we equate living with the dynamism of movement and in this case migration be that external or internal. This research is separated into two parts, international and national with China as a case study. We aim to satisfy both research and technical documentation criteria in order to allow for a greater understanding of design and analysis choices in the accompanying hosted output.
